16 to 32	1st	The lower human threshold of hearing, and the lowest pedal notes of a pipe organ.
32 to 512	2nd to 5th	Rhythm frequencies, where the lower and upper bass notes lie.
512 to 2048	6th to 7th	Defines human speech intelligibility, gives a horn-like or tinny quality to sound.
2048 to 8192	8th to 9th	Gives presence to speech, where labial and fricative sounds puss.
8192 to 16384	10th	Brilliance, the sounds of bells and the ringing of cymbals and sibilance in speech.
16384 to 32768 11th Beyond brilliance, nebulous sounds approaching and just passing the upper human threshold of hearing
